      By default, the Action will use the recommended version of the CodeQL
      Bundle to analyze your project. You can override this choice using this
      input. One of:

      - A local path to a CodeQL Bundle tarball, or
      - The URL of a CodeQL Bundle tarball GitHub release asset, or
      - A special value `linked` which uses the version of the CodeQL tools
        that the Action has been bundled with.
      - A special value `nightly` which uses the latest nightly version of the
        CodeQL tools. Note that this is unstable and not recommended for
        production use.

      If not specified, the Action will check in several places until it finds
      the CodeQL tools.
