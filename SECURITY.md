# 🔒 Security Policy

## 🧭 Overview
This project follows a **security-by-design** and **security-by-default** approach.  
We encourage responsible disclosure and continuous improvement of our security posture.

If you believe you have found a vulnerability or weakness, **please follow the disclosure process below** — do **not** open a public issue.

---

## 📩 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue, please **report it privately**:

- Email: security@[yourdomain].com  
- PGP Key (optional): [link to your public key or keybase.io]  
- Subject: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - [Project Name]`

We commit to:
1. Acknowledge receipt within **48 hours**  
2. Provide an initial assessment within **5 business days**  
3. Keep you updated until resolution and disclosure (if applicable)

---

## 🧪 Security Testing

You may test this project **in a non-destructive and ethical manner**.  
Do not perform:
- Denial of service (DoS/DDoS)  
- Resource exhaustion or fuzzing in production  
- Exploitation of other users’ data  

If you run security tools (e.g., Semgrep, npm audit, Trivy, OWASP ZAP), use them on **local or staging environments only**.

## 🧱 Secure Development Practices

This Node.js project follows the **OWASP Secure Coding Guidelines (2025)** and **OpenSSF best practices**:

- All dependencies are scanned automatically with **npm audit**, **Snyk**, and **Trivy**.  
- Static analysis with **Semgrep** (CI enforced).  
- Dependency policy: no unmaintained or high-CVSS packages.  
- Secrets management via environment variables + **dotenv-safe**.  
- Linting rules enforce `no-eval`, `no-new-func`, and CSP compliance for front-end code.  
- Automatic scanning of pull requests using **GitHub Advanced Security (SARIF)** integration.

## 🔐 Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)

We maintain a private disclosure program for researchers who follow responsible disclosure.  
No monetary rewards are currently offered, but **contributors are credited** in release notes for valid reports.

## 🧰 Security Tools Used

- **Semgrep** → Static code analysis  
- **Trivy** → Container and dependency scanning  
- **npm audit / snyk** → Package vulnerability detection  
- **CodeQL (SARIF)** → CI security workflow integration  
- **OWASP ZAP / Burp Suite** → Dynamic testing in pre-prod
